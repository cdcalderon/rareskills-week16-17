# Question 5: What is the use for the reinitializer? Provide a minimal example of proper use in Solidity.

In the context of upgradeable contracts, initializers are used instead of constructors to set the initial state of a contract. This is because constructors are not called when a contract is created via a proxy, which is how upgradeable contracts are implemented.

However, when a contract is upgraded, it may be necessary to reset or update the state of the contract. This is where a "reinitializer" function would come in. This function is designed to be called when the contract is upgraded and performs any necessary state updates.

Here is a minimal example in Solidity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";

contract MyContract is Initializable {
    uint256 public x;

    function initialize(uint256 _x) public initializer {
        x = _x;
    }

    function reinitialize(uint256 _x) public {
        x = _x;
    }
}
```

In this example, `initialize` is the initializer function that is called when the contract is first created. `reinitialize` is the `reinitializer` function that can be called to update the state of the contract after it has been upgraded.
