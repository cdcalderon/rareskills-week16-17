# Question 1: What are the six types of errors that the OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades plugin helps to prevent, and why are they significant?

The OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades plugin is a powerful tool for deploying and managing upgradeable contracts on the Ethereum network. It provides protection against several potential pitfalls that can arise during the contract upgrade process:

1. **Unstructured Storage Protection**: The plugin strategically uses `keccak` to calculate specific storage slots for storing essential values (implementation, beacon, and admin). This method safeguards these slots from unintended overwrites, ensuring the proxy operates correctly.

2. **Constructor Issues and Unsafe Implementations**: The plugin addresses the issue that the constructor's bytecode is not part of the runtime code and hence won't execute within the proxy's context. It does this by shifting this code from the constructor to an initializer function, which is invoked when the proxy links to the logic contract. This function is designed to run only once, avoiding multiple executions. Additionally, the plugin ensures that the contract implementation doesn't use unsafe features like the `selfdestruct` opcode and `delegatecall` opcode.

3. **Function Collisions**: The plugin uses the address of the caller to decide whether to delegate the call. If the admin is the caller, the proxy will not delegate any calls, thereby avoiding function clashes.

4. **Incompatible Upgrades**: The plugin checks the new implementation for upgrade safety and compatibility with the previous implementation during a contract upgrade. This check is vital because altering the order or type of state variables in a contract can lead to storage corruption during the upgrade.

5. **Missing Proxy Admin**: The plugin automatically deploys a proxy admin for your project if required. The proxy admin is the account with the rights to upgrade the proxy. Without it, you cannot upgrade your contracts.

6. **Redundant Deployments and Untracked Deployments**: The plugin checks for an existing implementation contract with the same bytecode before deploying a new one, preventing unnecessary deployments. It also keeps track of all deployed implementation contracts in an `.openzeppelin` folder in the project root, including the proxy admin. This tracking is crucial for project management and for keeping track of which contracts have been deployed and where.

These safeguards are crucial as mistakes in the upgrade process can lead to loss of funds, corrupted contract storage, or contracts becoming stuck in an irrecoverable state. By using the OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades plugin, you can sidestep these issues and ensure a safe and reliable upgrade process.
